## Legal Wordlists (Recommended)

We **strongly discourage** using illegal or unauthorized password dumps. For ethical testing or CTF practice, use wordlists from the excellent **SecLists Project**:

üì¶ **SecLists GitHub**  
üëâ https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

Clone it to your system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git /opt/SecLists
````

## How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ibrahim71Reza/Automated-Wordlist-Brute-Forcer.git
cd wordlist-cracker-automator
chmod +x script.sh
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Cracking Command

Edit the `CRACK_COMMAND` variable at the top of the script:

```bash
CRACK_COMMAND="flask-unsign --unsign --cookie '<YOUR_COOKIE>' --wordlist {WORDLIST} --no-literal-eval"
```

Replace:

* `<YOUR_COOKIE>` with your actual Flask cookie.
* `{WORDLIST}` **must stay unchanged** ‚Äî the script will substitute each wordlist file automatically.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Your Wordlist Directory

Modify the path in the script:

```bash
WORDLIST_DIR="/opt/SecLists/Passwords/"
```

This should point to your wordlist folder.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script

```bash
./script.sh
```
